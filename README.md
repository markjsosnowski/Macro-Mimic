# macro-mimic
An AHK script capable of reading in mouse and keyboard actions and then repeating those actions on a loop or trigger.
mimic.ini will allow for changing of settings without editing the script file. 

TODO:

• Add a quick access "click repetitively in one spot" option

• Add a "execute a recorded sequence on a trigger key" option 

• Update to using InputHook instead of Input (should solve the modifier key problem)

• Get the .ini working and possibly a GUI window to easily edit the .ini

• Save a recording to a file to be loaded and played back at any time. 

• Add a main menu GUI window that enables quick access to these features
